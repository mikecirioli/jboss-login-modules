What is it?
-----------
This project contains a number of JBoss EAP/WildFly login-modules that can be used to perform container level 
authentication and authorization.  

Included modules:

    JbossRadiusLoginModule - performs RADIUS OTP based authentication
    
    StaticLoginModule      - useful for test, this module can be configured to allow a static 
                             username and password, static username and any passowrd, or 
                             static password and any username
                             
    StaticRoleLoginModule  - this module performs no authentication, but can be configured to 
                             provide a static role for authenticated users.  This module is 
                             meant to be used in conjunction with password-stacking

    DebugLoginModule       - This module does no authentication or authorization, but will 
                             dump information about the jaas principle and roles known to 
                             the container.  This module is meant to be used in conjunction 
                             with password-stacking
